# FAIG-Stocks
FAIG (Fully Automated IG) ... With stocks, FTSE100

I have created FAIG ... But now with FTSE 100 stocks and Quandl API and Data from the London Stock Exchange

Same as FAIG (https://github.com/tg12/FAIG), But you will need a Quandl API (Free) and install the Quandl Package, Python 3 as usual.
